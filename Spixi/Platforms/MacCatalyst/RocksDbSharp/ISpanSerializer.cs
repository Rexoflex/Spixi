// beside this folder) — the commit the dev's RocksDB.0.0.42.nupkg names in its nuspec metadata (his DLL is a
// MODIFIED build of it: a static __Internal binding for iOS/Android; this is the public source). Compiled for the
// maccatalyst TFM ONLY (the csproj removes Platforms/MacCatalyst/**/*.cs from every other TFM).
// The ONLY edited file is AutoNativeImport.cs (the Catalyst patch, marked "#920"); this file is
// identical to upstream below this header (modulo BOM, CRLF and the final newline). Re-vendor: see README.md beside this folder.
